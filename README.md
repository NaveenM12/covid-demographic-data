# COVID Demographic Data Formatting

This project is designed to take the sraped raw data from [obastani/covid19demographics](https://github.com/obastani/covid19demographics) and format it for processing/plotting/publication. We are currently only focusing on plotting COVID-19 infection/death rates over time *by age*. 


## Installation

If using `conda`:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate covid
```

If using `venv` and `pip`:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If using neither, make sure you have the packages listed in `requirements.txt` installed in your Python environment (you don't need to install `jupyterlab` if not using Jupyter Lab).

## State Data Formatters

For all states in our dataset, we need a formatter that reads the raw data from [obastani/covid19demographics](https://github.com/obastani/covid19demographics) and extracts the age-group panel data. When a formatter has been written, add it to the `code/formatters.py` file and the `state_functions` dictionary therein. See the current file for formatters that have already been complete.

To get a sense of what a formatting function should do, refer to `notebooks/SampleCode.ipynb`. In brief, formatters take the raw json (e.g., `raw_json["USA"]["AL"]`) for a given state and 
return a timeseries of either cases/deaths, with any duplicate or missing dates removed. 

Columns should be formatted as "{low}-{high}", for each age bucket reported. Because states have changed their reporting buckets over time, dates with a missing entry for that particular bucket should be filled with `NaN`. The index of the returned dataframe should be the date in `datetime.date` format (not `datetime.datetime`).

Example data below:

```python
AL_formatter(raw_json["USA"]["AL"]).head()
```
